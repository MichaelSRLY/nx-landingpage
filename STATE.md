## Design Decisions Made
1. **Color Palette:** Warm paper aesthetic with HSL colors anchored in 30-40° hue range
   - Light: cream background hsl(40, 30%, 97%), tan cards hsl(40, 25%, 95%)
   - Dark: charcoal base hsl(30, 5%, 10.5%), elevated surfaces hsl(30, 5%, 12%)
2. **Typography:** Geist Sans (primary), Geist Mono (code)
3. **Design Inspiration:** reap-odyssey.vercel.app - clean, dark, minimalist
4. **Escher Elements:** Subtle geometric patterns (tessellation, isometric), decorative hexagons
5. **Component Architecture:** Modular, reusable components with TypeScript
