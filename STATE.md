# Current State

## Status
**PHASE: Design System Complete - Ready for Implementation**

Next.js project initialized with design system documented.

## What's Working
- ✅ Next.js 16.1.6 initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
- ✅ Database connection available
- ✅ Design system documented (design.md + design.json)
- ✅ Warm paper aesthetic defined (HSL 30-40° hue range)
- ✅ Dark mode specifications ready
- ✅ Escher-inspired design elements planned

## Current Focus
Implementing the Nexora landing page with:
- Dark-first design (charcoal base with warm undertones)
- Clean, minimalist layout inspired by reap-odyssey.vercel.app
- Geist Sans typography
- Responsive mobile-first approach

## Design Decisions Made
1. **Color Palette:** Warm paper aesthetic with HSL colors anchored in 30-40° hue range
   - Light: cream background hsl(40, 30%, 97%), tan cards hsl(40, 25%, 95%)
   - Dark: charcoal base hsl(30, 5%, 10.5%), elevated surfaces hsl(30, 5%, 12%)
2. **Typography:** Geist Sans (primary), Geist Mono (code)
3. **Design Inspiration:** reap-odyssey.vercel.app - clean, dark, minimalist
4. **Escher Elements:** Subtle geometric patterns, tessellations, perspective play
